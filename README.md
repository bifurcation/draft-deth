DETH: DNS Editing Through HTTPS

## Editor's version

See http://hildjj.github.io/draft-deth/ for the most current version.

## Installation

To start editing:

    $ npm install
    $ npm install -g gulp
    $ gem install kramdown-rfc2629
    $ pip install xml2rfc

Edit `draft-hildebrand-deth.md` using the hints found
[here](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629).  To view, run:

    $ gulp

This will compile the HTML version of the draft, start a small web server, and
open a browser window pointing to the HTML.  Now, as you save changes to `draft-hildebrand-deth.md`, your browser will automatically
update with the changes.
